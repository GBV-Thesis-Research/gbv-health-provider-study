# Analysis plan

## Background

## Aims

Aim 1: To assess change in individual health provider knowledge, attitudes, empathy, and confidence in responding to gender-based violence (GBV) before and after participation in the 'Responding to GBV' curriculum in the intervention municipalities in Timor-Leste.
  Sub-aim 1.1: To assess change in self-reported provider practices in identifying and responding to gender based violence in the past    month.

Aim 2: To assess change in advancing individual health providersâ€™ knowledge, attitudes, and empathy related to GBV after the 14-month Learning Lab curriculum when compared to the 5-day intensive training, using baseline, post-intensive, and endline data.

## Study details

**Design:** Pre/post intervention comparison
**Population:** Healthcare providers in Liquica and Ermera municipalities, Timor-Leste.
**Sites:** 10 community health centers (CHCs) total, 6 in Liquica and 4 in Ermera municipality. Health post staff were eligible to attend at their local CHC, with a maximum of 63 health posts in the municipalities.
**Sample size:** Timepoints 1-3 had 216, 208, and 252 respondents who consented to research respectively. Across all three timepoints, we were able to match 57 participants. 

## Outcome
Scores in six domains: 1) knowledge, 2) attitudes, 3) system support, 4) confidence, 5) empathy and 6) practices. The domains of knowledge and attitudes had four sub-domains each. Knowledge was broken up into: 1) general knowledge of GBV, 2) warning signs of GBV, 3) appropriate ways to ask about GBV and 4) helpful responses to support a woman subjected to GBV. Attitudes was broken up into: 1) general attitudes towards GBV and the health provider role, 2) acceptability for a man to his his partner, 3) attitudes towards gender roles, and 4) attitudes towards professional roles.
